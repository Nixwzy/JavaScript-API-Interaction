# HTTP Requests Project 🌐

## Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates the use of **HTTP requests** with **Fetch API**, showcasing two approaches:  
1. **Using `.then` for handling promises**.  
2. **Using `async/await` for modern and cleaner asynchronous code**.  

The goal is to illustrate both methods while allowing the user to toggle between them, improving understanding of these techniques in JavaScript.

## Features 🌟
- **GET**: Fetch a list of posts from a public API.
- **POST**: Add a new post to the API.
- **PUT**: Update an existing post by its ID.
- **DELETE**: Remove a post by its ID.
- **Mode Toggle**: Switch between `.then` and `async/await` implementations.

## Files 📂
- **HTML**: A simple interface with buttons for each request type and a toggle for switching modes.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Modularized code for DOM manipulation and API interaction, separated into:
  - `api.js`: Handles API requests.
  - `dom.js`: Manages DOM elements and events.
  - `main.js`: Initializes event listeners and application logic.

## Learnings & Goals 📚
This project serves as a hands-on example to:
- Practice **Fetch API**.
- Understand **.then** vs **async/await**.
- Work with **modular JavaScript**.
- Improve **error handling** in API requests.

---

## Current Status 📈
The project is complete with basic functionality. Future updates may include:
- **Log Panel**: Display request responses dynamically in the browser.
- **Code Preview**: Show the executed code snippet for each request type.
- **Improved UI/UX**: A polished design for better usability.
